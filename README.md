It is a project I did in B.Tech. It is in association with E&ICT academy IIT GHY with collaboration with VLSI EXPERT.
I was provided with block diagram and the instructions to design a 32 bit processor and i had to design the logic around it to control the speed of a moving car as well its braking functionality based on the distance of the obstacle.
